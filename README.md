<h1 style="font-size: 5em; text-align: center; margin-top: 1.5em; ">We are eloping in Manhattan!</h1>

## Friday March 4

*We're sad that eloping means many of you can not make it, and we will hold a second reception in Europe later in the year*

**8:30 - 9** We will meet at the City Clerk's Office from 8.30am and will go inside at 9.
The courthouse allows up to 30 people to come in with us so, if you can't make, it's no problem we'll see you for the party.
If you can, RSVP to Gabriela so we know what to plan for :)

**9 - 10** There's no booking system because it’s first come first served, but we expect to be inside the City Clerk's Office for about an hour. 

**10 - 11** Assuming the weather is good, we will then walk down to City Hall Park and take more photos, potentially up to Brooklyn Bridge. If the weather is not good, we'll head straight to Lisa’s house.

**At 11** we'll walk back up to the Canal St subway station and take the yellow Q line towards Coney Island to a private residence.

**12 - 4** We'll be at the house until about 4 and, we know it’s a workday, so drop in if your schedule allows. 
This is a party! 

**8 onwards:** For all of our friends who can't make the day festivities, we’ll be at the Dream Downtown hotel bar for drinks.
We recommend the Ginger Lemonade (Puerto Rico + England!) 
Once again, feel free to drop by as time allows, we’d just love to see your face!

### P.S. Gifts

We don't really need more things. 
There are some kinds of kitchen items that would be lovely, though not necessary at all. 
They can be [found on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/353LWQHVKE8V3).
